The method is called when a view is first loaded, but the view hasn't displayed on the screen. If we implement the animation in this method, the animation may start too early and probably finish even before the view appears on the screen. The method, on the other hand, is automatically called after by iOS when the view is about to appear on the screen. It is more suitable for us to render the animation. This is why we write the code in rather than .

The API will automatically compute the animation for you. The duration parameter specifies the duration of the animation. In this example, the animation will complete in 2 seconds.
