# BookForSnack - iOS Project
🍽️ A Swift iOS project to manage Restaurants food

```
— Made this project in 2017 to learn the iOS Swift ecosystem.
— This project uses MVC (Model View Controller) and CoreData.
— Over the years, I have worked with bigger and impactful projects.
```
I have used:
```
- 𝘛𝘰𝘰𝘬 𝘵𝘩𝘦 '𝘞𝘦 𝘏𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘚𝘸𝘪𝘧𝘵' 𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘸𝘪𝘧𝘵 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘪𝘯 2017.
- 𝘗𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘦𝘥 '𝘈𝘱𝘱𝘊𝘰𝘥𝘢 𝘪𝘖𝘚 𝘗𝘳𝘰𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘚𝘸𝘪𝘧𝘵' 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘯 𝘪𝘖𝘚 𝘢𝘱𝘱 𝘪𝘯 2017.
```

This is made with the MVC ( Model View Controller ) pattern, and the project also uses CoreData for persistance.

## ⚠️ *I'm adding this project to the public for portfolio use only; it was my first Swift iOS project, created in 2017 when I began learning to code for iOS (using the AppCoda.com academy).*
