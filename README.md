# BookForSnack - iOS Project
A Swift project to manage Restaurants food

## ⚠️ I'm adding this project to the public as it is my first Swift iOS project that I made in 2017 when I learned how to code on iOS ( using AppCoda.com ).

I have used:

Courses
- 𝘗𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘦𝘥 '𝘈𝘱𝘱𝘊𝘰𝘥𝘢 𝘪𝘖𝘚 𝘗𝘳𝘰𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘚𝘸𝘪𝘧𝘵' 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘯 𝘪𝘖𝘚 𝘢𝘱𝘱 𝘪𝘯 2017.
- 𝘛𝘰𝘰𝘬 𝘵𝘩𝘦 '𝘞𝘦 𝘏𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘚𝘸𝘪𝘧𝘵' 𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘸𝘪𝘧𝘵 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘪𝘯 2017.


This is made with the MVC ( Model View Controller ) pattern, so please do not criticise as it is my first project in 2017, most probably it no longer compiles and will need some additons.

The project also uses CoreData for persistance.

Check the video on how it works:
